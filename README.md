This is the Server for the Scrumboard built using Springboot. \
This Project was generated using Spring Initialiser and Spring Tool Suite was used for development.\

## Requirements

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)
- [Maven 4](https://maven.apache.org)
- [STS v3.9.10](https://download.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/update/3.9.10.RELEASE/e4.13/springsource-tool-suite-3.9.10.RELEASE-e4.13.0-updatesite.zip)


## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.example.demo.ProjectdemoApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the Spring Tool Suite like so:

```shell
1. Right Click on the project root folder and click "Run As"
2. Choose "Spring Boot App"
3. This should start the server
```

## Running unit tests

Furthermore you can test the application using STS itself.
```shell
1. Right Click on the project root folder and click "Run As"
2. Choose "JUnit Test"
3. This should give the test results with coverage
```
